# Getting Started With ownCloud #

This Getting Started Guide describes a manual Linux installation. For other types of installations, see the Table of Contents on the [Download ownCloud page](https://owncloud.org/download/). This Getting Started Guide describes how to do the following.

- Install and configure an ownCloud server.
- Add a user account.
- Enable users to connect to the ownCloud server using a desktop or mobile client. 

## Installing and Configuring an ownCloud Server ##

### Before You Begin ###

- Log in with Administrator privileges.
- Ensure that [supported PHP extensions](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites) (version 7.2 or later) are installed, enabled, and configured on your Linux system.- 
- Depending on the version of Linux you are running, install the [required packages, modules, and extensions](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#ubuntu-installation-label) needed to support ownCloud.

### Install ownCloud

Install ownCloud by performing the following steps.

1. Browse to the [Download ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/download/) page.
2. Navigate to the section **Resources > Tarball** and download either the tar or zip archive. The downloaded file is named owncloud-*x*.*y*.*z*.tar.bz2 or owncloud-*x*.*y*.*z*.zip (where *x*.*y*.*z* is the version number).
3. Download the corresponding checksum file for validation. For example, owncloud-*x*.*y*.*z*.tar.bz2.md5, or owncloud-*x*.*y*.*z*.tar.bz2.sha256, (where *x*.*y*.*z* is the version number).
4. Verify the MD5 or SHA256 sum, using the following commands as examples.     

	 
	``md5sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2``

	``sha256sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2``

    ``md5sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip``

    ``sha256sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip``
	

1. Verify the PGP signature for authenticity, using the following commands as examples.

     
    ``wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc``

    ``wget https://owncloud.org/owncloud.asc``

    ``gpg --import owncloud.asc``

    ``gpg --verify owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2``
  
1. Extract the archive contents by running the appropriate  command for your archive type, unpacking the archive to a single ownCloud directory. Use the following commands as examples.

	``tar -xjf owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2``

	``unzip owncloud-x.y.z.zip``


1. Copy the ownCloud directory to the destination. If you are running the Apache HTTP server, you install ownCloud in your Apache *document root* by entering the following command, where */path/to/webserver/document-root* is the path to your Web server.  

	``cp -r owncloud /path/to/webserver/document-root``

	For example: ``cp -r owncloud /var/www``

	*Note: On other HTTP servers, install ownCloud outside of the document root.*

### Configure Apache Web Server


1. On Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, create a ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf`` file with these lines in it, replacing the *Directory* and other file paths with your own file paths:

	``Alias /owncloud "/var/www/owncloud/"``
	
	``<Directory /var/www/owncloud/>``
	
	``Options +FollowSymlinks``
	
	``AllowOverride All``
	
	``<IfModule mod_dav.c>``
	
	``Dav off``
	
	`` </IfModule>``
	
	``SetEnv HOME /var/www/owncloud``
	
	``SetEnv HTTP_HOME /var/www/owncloud``
	
	``</Directory>``

1. Create a symbolic link to ``/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`` by entering the following command.

	``ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/owncloud.conf``

1. Enable required modules by running these commands.

    ``a2enmod rewrite``

    ``a2enmod headers``

    ``a2enmod env``

    ``a2enmod dir``

    ``a2enmod mime``

*Note: See [Additional Apache Configurations](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#install-owncloud)  for additional considerations based on your installation.*

### Enable SSL

We strongly recommend using SSL/TLS to encrypt all of your server traffic, and to protect user log-ins and data in transit.

Enable Apache's ``ssl`` module and default site by running the following in a terminal window:

``a2enmod ssl``
``a2ensite default-ssl``
``service apache2 reload``

### Run the Installation Wizard

1. Restart the Apache server.
2. Run the [Installation Wizard](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/installation_wizard.html) with GUI or the command line (using the ``occ`` command). If you use the command line, see **Run the Installation Wizard** on the ownCloud site for details about changing and setting permissions, managing trusted domains among other important considerations.  

### Configure the ownCloud Server

Although you do not need to customize the server configuration file, you may choose to do so in the event that you want to specify a specific port for ownCloud to listen for requests from clients.

To specify a particular IP address and port number to connect directly to ownCloud, do the following.

1. Open the ownCloud server configuration file for editing. On Linux, this file is located at:  ``HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg``.
2. In the **Proxy** section, set the following values:
	- For **Host**, specify the IP address of the server that users will connect to, for example **127.0.0.1**.
	- For **Port**, specify a secure port, such as **8080**. 
	- For **Type**, specify **2**, indicating that this server is not being used as an explicit proxy.
2. Save and close the configuration file.

See the section **Enable Users to Connect to the ownCloud Server** in this Getting Started Guide for steps to connect from either a desktop or mobile client.

*Note: See the [ownCloud Server Configuration page](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/server/index.html) for a complete list of configuration tasks.*

## Add a User Account

Define a new user to the ownCloud server by entering the following command. 

	user:add [--password-from-env] [--display-name [DISPLAY-NAME]] 
      [--email [EMAIL]] [-g|--group [GROUP]] [--] <uid>


	
where:

-	*password-from-env* specifies that the user's password be the same as their domain password.
- 	*display name* is the user's  full name that appears on the User's page in the ownCloud Web user interface.
- 	*email address* is the user's email address.
- 	*group* is the group name to which the user belongs.
- 	*uid* is user’s user name and their log-in name.
	
See **User Management** in the [ownCloud Server Configuration page](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/user/index.html) for a complete list of additional arguments, examples of user commands and other user management tasks.

## Enable Users to Connect to the ownCloud Server

Users connect to the ownCloud server using either a desktop or mobile client.

### Connecting with a Desktop Client

To connect to ownCloud with a desktop, install the [Desktop Synchronization Client](https://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/2.5/installing.html). After doing so, users can launch the client, log-in, and synchronize, upload, and download files.

### Connecting with a Mobile Client

To connect to ownCloud with a mobile device, install the [ownCloud mobile application](https://owncloud.com/apps/).  After doing so, users can log-in and synchronize, upload, and download files from any compatible mobile device including phones and tablets.

Connect with your browser pointing to your ownCloud server with IP and, optionally, port number. For example:

``https://www.example.org/owncloud``
``https://127.0.0.1:8080/owncloud``


For detailed information on using the clients, see the [ownCloud Client User Manual](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.2/user_manual/files/access_webdav.html).
